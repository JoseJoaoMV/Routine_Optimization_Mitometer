
Routine Optimization - MATLAB APP

Version 1.0 ***New Version 1.1 Available***


Overview:

----------------------

This routine is designed for automated data analysis of 3D live imaged mitochondria using the Mitometer MATLAB APP. It reads .txt files and performs the necessary calculations to produce a single value for a given parameter of a selected image stack. The routine further concatenates all the image stack parameter values into a single, easy-to-handle Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Please note that this optimization routine works synergistically with the MitoMeter tool.


Usage:

----------------------

1. Place the 'getTXTfiles.m' and 'mitometer2table.m' functions files in each image folder with Mitometer generated .txt files, contained in each data-set AT/PN/TN folders.

2. Ensure that no changes are made to the names of the .txt files generated by the MitoMeter APP, as it is essential for the routine to function properly.
